> ## Briefly About Myself:
I started my professional journey as a Java developer at Nadra Bank in Ukraine, with minimal experience. However, my determination to write short and useful programs quickly became apparent. Intrigued by the intricacies of web technologies, I moved to a QA position in an IT company with the prospect of becoming a front-end C# developer. My keen attention to detail and responsibility have led to significant advances in manual, automated testing and quality management over the past 20 years.

Due to my move to Belgium, I had the opportunity to start learning Front-End development with a focus on JavaScript. The world of web development has captivated me because it offers endless possibilities for creating useful applications. I have a genuine passion for learning and have received numerous certifications in various areas including Scrum, SAFe, Business Analysis, RestAPI in Testing, Java, and JavaScript Automation. Moreover, the IT industry offers many high-quality educational resources and a thriving developer community.

My journey in front-end development is based on my unwavering commitment to learning and acquiring new skills. I am confident that this path will lead me to become a highly skilled Frontend Developer.

I'm currently working part-time as a front-end developer and am hoping to find a new role that involves full stack development.

    for (let j = 0; j < m2[0].length; j += 1) {
      result[i][j] = (m1[i][0] * m2[0][j] + m1[i][1] * m2[1][j] + m1[i][2] * m2[2][j]);
    }
